Copycat is a feature complete, fully asynchronous implementation of the [Raft consensus algorithm][Raft] in Java 8
designed for use in [Atomix][Atomix]. The implementation provides a fully featured [client][clients] and [server][servers]
and includes:
* Pre-vote election protocol (§[4.2.3][dissertation])
* Session-based linearizable writes (§[6.3][dissertation])
* Lease-based fast linearizable reads from leaders (§[6.4.1][dissertation])
* Fast sequential reads from followers (§[6.4.1][dissertation])
* Sequential consistency for concurrent/asynchronous operations from a single client
* Session-based state machine events (§[6.3][dissertation])
* Membership changes (§[4.3][dissertation])
* Log compaction via cleaning (§[5.3][dissertation])

Additionally, this implementation has undergone extensive [Jepsen testing](http://github.com/jhalterman/copycat-jepsen)
to verify it maintains linearizability in a number of different failure scenarios.

*For more information on the Raft implementation itself, see [Raft internals](http://atomix.github.io/copycat/user-manual/internals/)*

### Project status: BETA

Copycat is a fault-tolerant framework that provides strong consistency guarantees, and as such we take the responsibility
to test these claims and document the implementation very seriously. Copycat's implementation of the
[Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) is well tested, well documented, and [verified by
Jepsen](https://github.com/atomix/atomix-jepsen). *But the beta label indicates that the implementation
may still have some bugs* or other issues that make it not quite suitable for production. Users are encouraged to
use Copycat in development and contribute to the increasing stability of the project with [issues](https://github.com/atomix/copycat/issues)
and [pull requests](https://github.com/atomix/copycat/pulls). Once we've reached consensus on the lack of significant
bugs in the beta release(s), a release candidate will be pushed. Once we've reached consensus on the stability of the 
release candidate(s) and Copycat's production readiness, a full release will be pushed.

**It's all about that consensus**!

Documentation for most of Copycat's implementation of the Raft algorithm is
[available on the Copycat website](http://atomix.github.io/copycat/user-manual/internals/), and users are encouraged
to [explore the Javadoc][Javadoc] which is also heavily documented. All documentation remains under continued
development, and websites for both Copycat and [Atomix][Atomix] will continue to be updated until and after a release.

## Examples

The [Atomix][Atomix] project is a collection of standalone Copycat `StateMachine`s and proxies that can be
multiplexed on a single Raft replicated log.
* [Distributed collections](https://github.com/atomix/atomix/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/io/atomix/collections/state/MapState.java)
* [Leader elections](https://github.com/atomix/atomix/blob/master/coordination/src/main/java/io/atomix/coordination/state/LeaderElectionState.java)
* [Locks](https://github.com/atomix/atomix/blob/master/coordination/src/main/java/io/atomix/coordination/state/LockState.java)
* [Group membership](https://github.com/atomix/atomix/blob/master/coordination/src/main/java/io/atomix/coordination/state/MembershipGroupState.java)
