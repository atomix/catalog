/**
 * Session keep alive request.
 * <p>
 * Keep alive requests are sent by clients to servers to maintain a session registered via
 * a {@link RegisterRequest}. Once a session has been registered, clients are responsible for sending
 * keep alive requests to the cluster at a rate less than the provided {@link RegisterResponse#timeout()}.
 * Keep alive requests also server to acknowledge the receipt of responses and events by the client.
 * The {@link #commandSequence()} number indicates the highest command sequence number for which the client
 * has received a response, and the {@link #eventVersion()} number indicates the highest index for which the
 * client has received an event in proper sequence.
