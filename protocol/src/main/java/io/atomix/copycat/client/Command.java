/**
 * Base interface for operations that modify system state.
 * <p>
 * Commands are submitted by clients to a Raft server and used to modify Raft cluster-wide state. When a command
 * is submitted to the cluster, if the command is received by a follower, the Raft protocol dictates that it must be
 * forwarded to the cluster leader. Once the leader receives a command, it logs and replicates the command to a majority
 * of the cluster before applying it to its state machine and responding with the result.
 * <p>
 * <b>Consistency levels</b>
 * <p>
 * Commands are allow both to modify system state and to trigger {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.session.Session#publish(String, Object) events}
 * published to client {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.session.Session sessions}. Whereas {@link Query} consistency
 * levels dictate when and how queries can be executed on follower nodes, command
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.Command.ConsistencyLevel consistency levels} largely relate to how events triggered
 * by commands are handled. When a command is applied to a server state machine, the consistency level of the command
 * being executed dictates the requirements for handling the event. For instance, in a fictitious lock state machine,
 * one command might be the {@code UnlockCommand}. The unlock command would set the state machine state to {@code unlocked}
 * and perhaps send a message to any lock waiters notifying them that the lock is available. In this case,
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.Command.ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE linearizable} consistency can be used to ensure
 * that lock holders are notified before the {@code unlock} operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Persistence levels</b>
 * <p>
 * <em>Determinism is the number one rule of state machines!</em>
 * <p>
 * When commands are submitted to the Raft cluster, they're written to a commit log on disk or in memory (based on the
 * storage configuration) and replicated to a majority of the cluster. As disk usage grows over time, servers compact
 * their logs to remove commands that no longer contribute to the state machine's state. In order to ensure state machines
 * remain deterministic, commands must provide {@link CompactionMode persistence levels}
 * to aid servers in deciding when it's safe to remove a command from the log. The persistence level allows state machines
 * to safely handle the complexities of removing state from state machines while ensuring state machines remain
 * deterministic, particularly in the event of a failure and replay of the commit log. See the
 * {@link CompactionMode} documentation for more info.
 * <p>
 * <b>Serialization</b>
 * <p>
 * Commands must be serializable both by the client and by all servers in the cluster. By default, all operations use
 * Java serialization. However, default serialization in slow because it requires the full class name and does not allocate
 * memory efficiently. For this reason, it's recommended that commands implement {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable}
 * or register a custom {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.TypeSerializer} for better performance. Serializable types
 * can be registered in a {@code META-INF/services/io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable} service loader file
 * or on the associated client/server {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.Serializer} instance.

   * Constants for specifying Raft command persistence levels.
   * <p>
   * This enum provides constants for specifying how a command should be persisted in and ultimately removed from the

   * in the log until major compaction. This is the case with <em>tombstones</em>. Tombstones are commands that remove
   * state from the state machine. Such commands need to be handled with care in order to ensure the state machine remains
   * deterministic. If a tombstone command is removed from the log before any commands for which it removed state, the
   * state machine should be considered non-deterministic. <em>Determinism is the number one rule for state machines!</em>

   * will ensure that the commands remain in the log until after any prior commands are removed. Note that in some cases
   * it may not be totally evident that a command needs to be marked persistent. For instance, in an imaginary map
   * state machine, a command that sets a key with a TTL (time-to-live) should be marked {@link #SEQUENTIAL} because,
   * while it contributes to the state machine's state for some time period, ultimately it removes state from the
   * state machine once it expires.
   * <p>
   * All commands that do not remove prior command state from a state machine can be safely marked {@link #CLEAN}.
