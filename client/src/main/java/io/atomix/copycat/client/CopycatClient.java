/**
 * Provides an interface for submitting {@link Command commands} and {@link Query} queries to the Copycat cluster.
 * <p>
 * Copycat clients are responsible for connecting to the cluster and submitting {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries}
 * that operate on the cluster's replicated state machine. Copycat clients interact with one or more nodes in a Copycat cluster
 * through a session. When the client is {@link #open() opened}, the client will attempt to one of the known member
 * {@link Address} provided to the builder. As long as the client can communicate with at least one correct member of the
 * cluster, it can open a session. Once the client is able to register a {@link Session}, it will receive an updated list
 * of members for the entire cluster and thereafter be allowed to communicate with all servers.
 * <p>
 * Sessions are created by registering the client through the cluster leader. Clients always connect to a single node in the
 * cluster, and in the event of a node failure or partition, the client will detect the failure and reconnect to a correct server.
 * <p>
 * Clients periodically send <em>keep-alive</em> requests to the server to which they're connected. The keep-alive request
 * interval is determined by the cluster's session timeout, and the session timeout is determined by the leader's configuration
 * at the time that the session is registered. This ensures that clients cannot be misconfigured with a keep-alive interval
 * greater than the cluster's session timeout.
 * <p>
 * Clients communicate with the distributed state machine by submitting {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries} to
 * the cluster through the {@link #submit(Command)} and {@link #submit(Query)} methods respectively:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   client.submit(new PutCommand("foo", "Hello world!")).thenAccept(result -> {
 *     System.out.println("Result is " + result);
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * All client methods are fully asynchronous and return {@link CompletableFuture}. To block until a method is complete, use
 * the {@link CompletableFuture#get()} or {@link CompletableFuture#join()} methods.
 * <p>
 * Sessions work to provide linearizable semantics for client {@link Command commands}. When a command is submitted to the cluster,
 * the command will be forwarded to the leader where it will be logged and replicated. Once the command is stored on a majority
 * of servers, the leader will apply it to its state machine and respond according to the command's {@link Command#consistency()}.
 * See the {@link Command.ConsistencyLevel} documentation for more info.
 * <p>
 * Sessions also allow {@link Query queries} (read-only requests) submitted by the client to optionally be executed on follower
 * nodes. When a query is submitted to the cluster, the query's {@link Query#consistency()} will be used to determine how the
 * query is handled. For queries with stronger consistency levels, they will be forwarded to the cluster's leader. For weaker
 * consistency queries, they may be executed on follower nodes according to the consistency level constraints. See the
 * {@link Query.ConsistencyLevel} documentation for more info.
